# Pong SDL2 C++

Extremely dirty testing ground for different game design concepts
(sometimes conflicting) in the same space.

There is no clearly defined architecture, and things may seem at odds. This is
not a complete implementation of pong, but a constant cycle of iterative polish
to test different patterns and evaluate trade-offs early (by having the same
thing done 4 different ways in different places).
